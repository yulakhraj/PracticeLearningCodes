Design Pattern
-->A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem that occurs during software design. 
-->It's like a blueprint or template that developers can use to solve a specific design problem.
-->Design patterns help to improve the quality of software by providing a common language and framework for 
	developers to communicate and discuss software design concepts.
